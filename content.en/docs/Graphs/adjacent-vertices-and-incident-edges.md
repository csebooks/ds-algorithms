### Undirected Graph
- If (v1, v2) is an edge, then vertices v1 and v2 are said to be **adjacent**
- The edge (v1, v2) is **incident** on vertices v1 and v2

**Example:** In G1, vertex 2 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, and 4. The edges incident on vertex 3 are (1,3), (2,3), and (4,3).

### Directed Graph
- If `<v1, v2>` is a directed edge, then vertex v1 is said to be **adjacent to** v2 while v2 is **adjacent from** v1
- The edge `<v1, v2>` is incident on v1 and v2

**Example:** In G2, vertices 1 and 3 are adjacent to vertex 2, whereas vertex 2 is adjacent from vertex 1.
