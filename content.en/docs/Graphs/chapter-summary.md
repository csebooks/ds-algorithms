| Point | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| (a) | There are two types of graphs—directed graph and undirected graph |
| (b) | A graph can be represented using an adjacency matrix, adjacency lists, or adjacency multi-lists |
| (c) | There are two algorithms for graph traversal—depth first search and breadth first search |
| (d) | A spanning tree is an undirected tree consisting of only those edges necessary to connect all vertices |
| (e) | Minimum cost spanning tree can be obtained using Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm |
| (f) | The shortest path between vertices in a weighted directed graph can be obtained using Dijkstra's algorithm |
