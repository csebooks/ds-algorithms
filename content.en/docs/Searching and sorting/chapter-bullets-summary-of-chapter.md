(a) Searching an element in a list can be done using linear search or binary search algorithm.

(b) Binary search algorithm is more efficient than linear search algorithm.

(c) Binary search algorithm expects the elements of a list in ascending order.

(d) Binary search can be done iteratively or recursively.

(e) Internal sorting is used when the input data can be accommodated in memory.

(f) External sorting is used when data is so huge that all of it cannot be stored in memory at a time.

(g) Common internal sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, binary tree sort and heap sort.
