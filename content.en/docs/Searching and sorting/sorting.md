Sorting refers to arranging elements of a set in some order. There are different methods that are used to sort the data in ascending or descending order. These methods can be divided into two categories. They are as follows:

### Internal Sorting

If all the data to be sorted can be accommodated at a time in memory, then internal sorting methods are used.

### External Sorting

When the data to be sorted is so large that some of the data is present in the memory and some is kept in auxiliary memory (hard disk, tape, etc.), then external sorting methods are used. Let us begin with internal sorting methods.
