title: Common Matrix Operations
weight: 3
---

Common matrix operations are addition, multiplication, transposition, etc. Let us see how these operations are carried out on a sparse matrix implemented as an array. Note that each program that we are going to discuss now consists of functions—`create_array()`, `create_tuple()`, `display()`, `display_tuple()` and `count()`. We have already seen the working of these functions in previous program. Hence, we shall discuss only the function(s) that perform given matrix operation.
