### Why This Chapter Matters?

Be it items in a store, books in a library, or notes in a bank, the moment they become more than handful we start stacking them neatly. Similarly, while maintaining data in an orderly fashion it is placed in a stack. Stack data structure is used widely for storing variables, managing function calls, evaluating arithmetic expressions, etc. Hence it is important to understand this data structure.

Stack is a data structure in which addition of new element or deletion of an existing element always takes place at the same end. This end is known as **top of stack**. This situation can be compared to a stack of plates in a cafeteria where every new plate added to the stack is added at the top. Similarly, every new plate taken off the stack is also from the top of the stack. When an item is added to a stack, the operation is called **push**, and when an item is removed from the stack the operation is called **pop**. These operations are shown in Figure 5-1. Because of the nature of push and pop operations Stack is also called **last-in-first-out (LIFO)** list.

A stack data structure can be maintained as an array or as a linked list. The following sections discuss these implementations.
