### Why This Chapter Matters?

The dictum "ends justify the means" doesn't hold good in Computer Science. Just because we got the right answer (end) does not mean that the method (means) that we employed to obtain it was correct. In fact, the efficiency of obtaining the correct answer is largely dependent on the method employed to obtain it. Hence scientific analysis of performance of the method is very important.
