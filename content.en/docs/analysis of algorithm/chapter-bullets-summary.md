| Point | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| (a) | Algorithm is a method of accomplishing a task in a finite number of steps. |
| (b) | An algorithm must have input, output, finiteness, definiteness and effectiveness. |
| (c) | Analysis of an algorithm involves determining time requirement or memory space requirement. |
| (d) | Asymptotic analysis evaluates an algorithm's performance in terms of input size. It calculates how time/space increases with input size. |
| (e) | Asymptotic notation describes 3 rates of growth: Big O, Big Ω and Big θ. |
| (f) | Usually, Big O analysis of an algorithm is done, as it determines the worst-case time complexity. |
| (g) | Though Asymptotic Analysis is not perfect, it is still the best way available to analyze algorithm's performance. |
| (h) | Time complexity of a function can be found out by determining the number of times the dominant operation is being performed in the function. |
| (i) | Order of growth of two functions can be compared by taking log of functions and substituting a large value in place of n. |
