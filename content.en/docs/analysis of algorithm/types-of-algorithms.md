Though the problems might be very different, it is possible that the algorithms used to solve them are similar. Hence algorithms are often classified as per their characteristics rather than the problem that they are attempting to solve.

**Common types of algorithms:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **(a) Iterative algorithms** | Use loops to repeat operations |
| **(b) Recursive algorithms** | Call themselves to solve smaller sub-problems |
| **(c) Backtracking algorithms** | Try different solutions and backtrack when needed |
| **(d) Divide and conquer algorithms** | Divide problem into sub-problems, solve independently |
| **(e) Dynamic programming algorithms** | Store results of sub-problems to avoid recomputation |
| **(f) Greedy algorithms** | Make locally optimal choices at each stage |
| **(g) Branch and bound algorithms** | Systematically enumerate candidate solutions |
| **(h) Brute force algorithms** | Try all possible solutions |
| **(i) Randomized algorithms** | Use random numbers to make decisions |
