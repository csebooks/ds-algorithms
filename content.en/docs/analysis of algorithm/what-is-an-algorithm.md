The method of solving a problem is known as an algorithm. More precisely, **an algorithm is a sequence of instructions that act on some input data to produce desired output in a finite number of steps.**

An algorithm must have the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **(a) Input** | An algorithm must receive some input data supplied externally. |
| **(b) Output** | An algorithm must produce at least one output as the result. |
| **(c) Finiteness** | No matter what the input might be, the algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. For example, a procedure which goes on performing a series of steps infinitely is not an algorithm. |
| **(d) Definiteness** | The steps to be performed in the algorithm must be clear and unambiguous. |
| **(e) Effectiveness** | One must be able to perform the steps in the algorithm without applying any intelligence. For example, the step—*Select three numbers which form a Pythagorean triplet*—is not effective. |
