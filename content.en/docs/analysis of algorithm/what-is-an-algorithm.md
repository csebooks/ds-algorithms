An **algorithm** is just a **step-by-step procedure** to solve a problem.

### Example  
**Problem:** Find the largest number in an array.

**Algorithm:**
1. Assume the first element is the largest.
2. Compare it with the next element.
3. If the next element is bigger → update largest.
4. Repeat until the end.
5. Return the largest number.

Simple. No complexity yet.
