Multiple algorithms may exist for solving a given problem. So, to be able to decide which algorithm to use, we need to analyze algorithms. There can be multiple yardsticks to determine which algorithm is better than the other. These include:

- **(a) Robustness** – Is the algorithm robust enough to tackle all types of valid and invalid inputs.
- **(b) Maintainability** – Is it easy to alter the algorithm as needs change in future.
- **(c) Scalability** – Can the algorithm deal with increase in the number of inputs.
- **(d) Modularity** – Can the algorithm be broken down into smaller sections (modules).
- **(e) Security** – Can the algorithm deal with malicious attacks.
- **(f) User-friendliness** – Is it easy to use the algorithm.
- **(g) Performance (efficiency)** – Does the algorithm take less time and memory space when implemented in a program.

Of these, the most popular yardstick used to analyze algorithms is **performance**. This is because it is easy to quantify time and space requirements of an algorithm.
