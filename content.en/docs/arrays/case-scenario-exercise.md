### Orthogonal Matrix

A square matrix is said to be **Orthogonal** if the matrix obtained by multiplying the matrix with its transpose is an identity matrix. In other words, if A is a matrix and T is its transpose, then matrix B obtained by multiplying A with T is called orthogonal if it is an identity matrix. An identity matrix is a square matrix in which the elements in the leading diagonal are 1. Write a program that receives a square matrix and determines whether it is Orthogonal or not.

*Orthogonal matrices have applications in field of numerical linear algebra.*

### Longest increasing sub-sequence

One of the interesting problems in Computer Science is to find the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence. The subsequence should be as long as possible and its elements must be in ascending order. The subsequence elements need not be in adjacent locations and the elements need not be distinct.

For example, in the following sequence:
```
0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15
```

the longest increasing subsequence is:
```
0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15
```

This subsequence has length six; the input sequence has no seven-member increasing subsequences. The longest increasing subsequence in this example is not unique. `0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15` or `0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15` are other increasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.

Write a program to obtain the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence.

*Longest increasing subsequences have applications in fields of random matrix theory, representation theory, and physics.*
