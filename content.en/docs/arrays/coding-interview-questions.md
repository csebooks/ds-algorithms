### Exercise Level III

(a) The Mode of an array of numbers is the number m in the array that is repeated most frequently. If more than one number is repeated with equal maximal frequencies, there is no mode. Write a program that accepts an array of numbers and returns the mode or an indication that the mode does not exist.

(b) Write a program to delete duplicate elements from an array of 20 integers.

(c) A square matrix is symmetric if for all values of i and j `a[i][j] = a[j][i]`. Write a program, which verifies whether a given 5×5 matrix is symmetric, or not.
