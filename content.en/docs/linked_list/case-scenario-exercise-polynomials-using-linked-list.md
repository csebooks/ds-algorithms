title: Case Scenario Exercise Polynomials using Linked List
weight: 12
---

Polynomials like 5x⁴ + 2x³ + 7x² + 10x - 8 can be maintained using a linked list. To achieve this each node should consist of three elements, namely coefficient, exponent and a link to the next term. Assume that the exponent of each successive term is less than that of the previous term. Write a program to build a linked list to represent a polynomial and perform common polynomial operations like addition and multiplication.
