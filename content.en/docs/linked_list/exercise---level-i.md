### [A] State whether the following statements are True or False:

(a) Linked list is used to store similar data.

(b) All nodes in the linked may be in non-contiguous memory locations.

(c) The link part of the last node in a singly linked list always contains NULL.

(d) In a singly linked list, if we lose the location of the first node it is as good as having lost the entire linked list.

(e) Doubly linked list facilitates movement from one node to another in either direction.

(f) A doubly linked list will occupy less memory as compared to a corresponding singly linked list.

(g) If we are to traverse from first node to last node it would be faster to do so if the linked list is singly linked instead of doubly linked.

(h) In a structure used to represent the node of a doubly linked list it is necessary that the structure elements are in the order backward link, data, forward link.
