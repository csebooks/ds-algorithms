A common and a wrong impression that beginners carry is that a linked list is used only for storing integers. However, a linked list can virtually be used for storing any similar data. For example, there can be a linked list of floats, a linked list of names, or even a linked list of records, where each record contains name, age and salary of an employee. These linked lists are shown in Figure 3-7.
