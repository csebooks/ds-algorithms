### [B] Answer the Following:

(a) Write a program that reads the name, age and salary of 10 persons and maintains them in a linked list sorted by name.

(b) There are two linked lists A and B containing the following data:
   - A: 3, 7, 10, 15, 16, 9, 22, 17, 32
   - B: 16, 2, 9, 13, 37, 8, 10, 1, 28

   Write a program to create:
   - A linked list C that contains only those elements that are common in linked list A and B.
   - A linked list D which contains all elements of A as well as B ensuring that there is no repetition of elements.

(c) There are two linked lists A and B containing the following data:
   - A: 7, 5, 3, 1, 20
   - B: 6, 25, 32, 11, 9

   Write a function to combine the two lists such that the resulting list contains nodes in the following elements:
   
   7, 6, 5, 25, 3, 32, 1, 11, 20, 9
   
   You are not allowed to create any additional node while writing the function.
