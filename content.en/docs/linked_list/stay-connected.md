### Why This Chapter Matters?

United we stand, divided we fall! More united and connected we are, more is the flexibility and scalability. Same is true with linked lists. Linked lists are used at numerous places in Computer Science. The flexibility and performance they offer is worth the pain of learning.

For storing similar data in memory we can use either an array or a linked list. Arrays are simple to understand and elements of an array are easily accessible. But arrays suffer from the following limitations:

- Arrays have a fixed dimension. Once the size of an array is decided it cannot be increased or decreased during execution.
- Insertion of a new element in an array is tedious because during insertion each element after the specified position has to be shifted one position to the right.
- Deletion of an existing element in an array is inefficient because during deletion each element after the specified position has to be shifted one position to the left.

Linked list overcomes all these disadvantages. A linked list can grow and shrink in size during its lifetime. Thus, there is no maximum size of a linked list. Also, unlike arrays, while inserting or deleting elements in a linked list shifting of existing elements is not required.
