**Binary search tree (BST)** is a variant of binary tree in which the nodes are arranged in a particular manner. A BST has the property that **all the elements in the left sub-tree of a node n are less than n and all the elements in the right sub-tree of n are greater than or equal to n**. Figure 7-7 shows a few sample BSTs.
