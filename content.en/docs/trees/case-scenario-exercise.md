### Dictionary implementation

We wish to maintain a dictionary of words as a binary tree. Each node should contain a word, its meaning, a synonym and an antonym. There must be a provision to insert a word, search a word and delete a word. It should be also possible to print the entire dictionary in alphabetical order.
