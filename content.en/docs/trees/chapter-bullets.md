- (a) Tree is a non-linear data structure.
- (b) Each node in a binary tree can have 0, 1 or 2 children.
- (c) Unlike trees in nature a binary tree has root at the top and leaves at the bottom with root node at level 0.
- (d) Depth of a node is largest number of links from root to that node.
- (e) Height of a node is largest number of links from leaf node to that node.
- (f) A binary tree can be traversed in in-order, pre-order and post-order fashion.
- (g) If we know any two sequences out of in-order, pre-order and postorder, it is possible to construct the binary tree.
- (h) A binary tree can be represented using array representation or linked representation.
- (i) BST and AVL trees are special types of binary trees. They are created with an aim to improve the efficiency of working with binary trees.
- (j) The property parent >= child is satisfied for all nodes in a max heap, and parent <= child for all nodes in a min heap.
