### Exercise - Level I

**[A] State whether the following statements are True or False:**

(a) A binary tree whose non-leaf nodes have left and the right child is a complete binary tree.

(b) The number of nodes attached to a particular node in a tree is called the degree of the node.

(c) To reconstruct a unique binary tree the in-order and pre-order lists are required.

(d) The balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is 1 if the height of the left sub-tree is one less than the height of the right sub-tree.

**[B] Fill in the blanks:**

(a) In a threaded binary tree, the address of the in-order predecessor and in-order successor are stored in _____ and _____ child of the leaf node respectively.

(b) In any node of B-tree of order n the minimum required values and children are _____ and _____ respectively.

(c) In a heap if the largest element is present at the root node then it is called as the _____

### Coding Interview Questions - Exercise Level III

**[D] Answer the Following:**

(a) Given any number, write a program to find whether that number is present in the binary tree. If present then find the level at which it is present.

(b) Given two binary trees, write a program that finds whether:
   - the two binary trees are similar
   - the two binary trees are mirror images of each other

(c) Write a program that finds the number of nodes in a binary tree at each level.

(d) Write a program that traverses a binary tree level by level, from left towards right.

(e) Write a function to insert a node t as a left child of any node s in a threaded binary tree.
