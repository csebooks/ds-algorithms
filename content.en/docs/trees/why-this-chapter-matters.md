Nature is man's best teacher. In every walk of life man has explored nature, learnt his lessons and then applied the knowledge that nature offered him to solve every-day problems that he faced at workplace. It isn't without reason that there are data structures like Trees, Binary Trees, Search Trees, AVL Trees, Forests, etc. Trees are non-linear data structures. They have many applications in Computer Science, hence you must understand them.

If large input data is stored in a linked list, then time required to access the data is prohibitive. In such cases a data structure called **Tree** is used. This data structure is often used in constructing the file systems and evaluation of arithmetic expressions. This data structure gives a running time of **O(log n)** for most operations.

Like linked lists, a tree also consists of several nodes. Each node may contain links that point to other nodes in the tree. So a tree can be used to represent a person and all of his descendants as shown in Figure 7-1.

Note that each node in this tree contains a name for data and one or more pointers to the other tree nodes. Although a tree may contain any number of pointers to the other tree nodes, a large number have at the most two pointers to the other tree nodes. Such trees are called **Binary trees**.
