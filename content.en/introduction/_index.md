# Introduction

In this chapter, we discuss the aims and goals of this text and briefly review programming concepts and discrete mathematics. We will

- See that how a program performs for reasonably large input is just as important as its performance on moderate amounts of input.

- Review good programming style.

- Summarize the basic mathematical background needed for the rest of the book.

- Briefly review recursion.
