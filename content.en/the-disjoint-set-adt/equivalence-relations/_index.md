# Equivalence Relations

A relation R is defined on a set S if for every pair of elements (a, b), a, b S, a R b is either true or false. If a R b is true, then we say that a is related to b.

An equivalence relation is a relation R that satisfies three properties:

1. (Reflexive) a R a, for all a S.

2. (Symmetric) a R b if and only if b R a.

3. (Transitive) a R b and b R c implies that a R c.

We'll consider several examples.

The relationship is not an equivalence relationship. Although it is reflexive, since a a, and transitive, since a b and b c implies a c, it is not symmetric, since a b does not imply b a.

Electrical connectivity, where all connections are by metal wires, is an equivalence relation. The relation is clearly reflexive, as any component is connected to itself. If a is electrically connected to b, then b must be electrically connected to a, so the relation is symmetric. Finally, if a is connected to b and b is connected to c, then a is connected to c. Thus electrical connectivity is an equivalence relation.

Two cities are related if they are in the same country. It is easily verified that this is an equivalence relation. Suppose town a is related to b if it is possible to travel from a to b by taking roads. This relation is an equivalence relation if all the roads are two-way.
